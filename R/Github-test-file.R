#'
#' It may be more viable, in the future, to do this from a VSCode terminal.
#' But I would really love for it to work naturally in the IDE.
#'
#' It worked! Okay, I know that I can mess around with this.
#' 
#' Okay, even cooler, I can go back and forth and do this in my
#' other repo open in VSCode. It's a bit janky, I know. But 
#' I can work with this.
